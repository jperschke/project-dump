# Invoice PDF & Clear System (No Apps Script Permissions)

This system creates a streamlined invoice process without requiring Google Apps Script permissions or access to shared drives.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Helper Cells in Your Invoice Sheet

Add these formulas to empty cells in your invoice (e.g., column H):

```
H1: Invoice Status
H2: =IF(B2="","INCOMPLETE","READY TO PROCESS")
H3: PDF Filename
H4: =B2&"_"&TEXT(TODAY(),"YYYY-MM-DD")&".pdf"
H5: Next Invoice #
H6: =IF(ISNUMBER(VALUE(RIGHT(B2,3))),("INV-"&TEXT(VALUE(RIGHT(B2,3))+1,"000")),B2)
```

### 2. Create a "Process Invoice" Button Area

In cells F1:G2, create a visual button:
- Merge cells F1:G2
- Add text: "ðŸ“„ PROCESS INVOICE"
- Format: Blue background, white text, bold, center aligned
- Add thick border

### 3. Set Up Data Validation for Quick Clear

Create a dropdown in cell H8:
- Data â†’ Data validation
- Criteria: List of items
- Items: "Keep Data,Clear Invoice"
- Show dropdown list in cell: âœ“

## How to Use the System

### Step 1: Complete Your Invoice
Fill out all invoice details as normal.

### Step 2: Generate PDF (Manual but Simple)
1. **Check Status**: Cell H2 should show "READY TO PROCESS"
2. **Note Filename**: Cell H4 shows the suggested PDF filename
3. **Create PDF**:
   - File â†’ Download â†’ PDF (.pdf)
   - Use the filename from H4
   - Choose your desired location (Downloads, Drive, etc.)

### Step 3: Clear Invoice for Next Use
1. **Select Range to Clear**: Highlight your data ranges (adjust as needed):
   ```
   B2:B4    (Invoice details)
   B6:B10   (Customer info)
   A13:E23  (Invoice items)
   B25:B27  (Totals)
   B29      (Notes)
   ```
2. **Clear Content**: Press Delete or Edit â†’ Delete values
3. **Set Next Invoice Number**: Copy value from H6 to B2
4. **Set Today's Date**: Enter today's date in B3
5. **Set Due Date**: Enter due date in B4 (or use formula =B3+30)

## Alternative: Semi-Automated Clearing

### Option A: Use Filter Views
1. Create a filter view with your invoice template
2. After PDF creation, reset to template view
3. Only reenter dynamic data (invoice #, dates, customer info)

### Option B: Template Sheet Method
1. **Create Template Sheet**: Duplicate your invoice sheet
2. **Clear all variable data** in template (keep formulas/formatting)
3. **Name it "Invoice_Template"**
4. **Process**:
   - Fill out invoice normally
   - Create PDF manually
   - Copy template sheet
   - Rename to current date
   - Continue with fresh template

### Option C: Keyboard Shortcuts Setup
Create custom shortcuts for common actions:
1. **Ctrl+Alt+C**: Select and clear invoice data ranges
2. **Ctrl+Alt+P**: Print/Download as PDF
3. **Ctrl+Alt+N**: Insert next invoice number

## Formulas for Automatic Calculations

Add these to make your invoice smarter:

### Auto-calculating fields:
```
Subtotal (B25): =SUM(E13:E23)
Tax (B26): =B25*0.08  // Adjust tax rate as needed
Total (B27): =B25+B26
Due Date (B4): =B3+30  // 30 days from invoice date
```

### Smart Invoice Numbering:
```
In B2: =IF(A1="Template","INV-001","INV-"&TEXT(ROW()-1,"000"))
```

## Professional Enhancement Ideas

### 1. Color-Coded Status System
- Green cells: Complete data
- Yellow cells: Needs attention  
- Red cells: Missing required info

### 2. Conditional Formatting Rules
```
Rule 1: If B2 is empty â†’ Red background
Rule 2: If customer info complete â†’ Green background
Rule 3: If totals > 0 â†’ Bold text
```

### 3. Data Validation Dropdowns
- Customer names (from separate list)
- Common product/service descriptions
- Standard rates and terms

### 4. Quick-Fill Customer Database
Create a separate sheet with customer info:
- Use VLOOKUP to auto-fill addresses from customer name
- Formula: =VLOOKUP(B6,Customers!A:E,2,FALSE)

## Backup & Version Control

### Method 1: Automatic Copies
1. **File â†’ Make a copy** before major changes
2. **Name with date**: "Invoice_System_2025-07-25"

### Method 2: Export Tracking
Keep a simple log:
- Sheet tab: "Invoice_Log" 
- Columns: Date, Invoice#, Customer, Amount, PDF_Created, Status
